## prefs

See `script/backup`

Backups of app preferences and associated files

- `behaviours.plist` - Choosy preferences
- `OpenInAppleMusic.app` - Used to open Apple Music links directly in Apple Music (with Choosy rules)
- `sublime` - all files with the `sublime-settings` extension. I don't use a lot of packages, so I don't bother including those in a backups
